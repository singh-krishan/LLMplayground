# LLMplayground
experimenting with LLM 

I am following this tutorial on Coursera: Generative AI for Software Development. The course is about how developers can use Large Language Model (LLM) in software development workflow. 

Project_1: 
1. Basic hello world API that
2. is packaged as a docker image and
3. then deployed as Kubernetes deployment (on Docker desktop)
4. and exposed as a service,
5. which can be accessed either through curl command or
6. a localhost URL
